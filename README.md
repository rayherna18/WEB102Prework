## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
* Challenges encountered were minor syntax (class name mispelled) errors that would make it so none of the gamecards show up.
* Another was an import statement that resulted in none of the JS from appearing. Once commented out, everything worked as expected.
